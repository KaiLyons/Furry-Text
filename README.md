# F--ing-Furries
A monstrocity made by a human

## How to run it
Either run it as a python script or get the runnable .bin file from releases [or click here](https://github.com/SafyreLyons/F--ing-Furries/releases/download/1/main.bin) and OMG does this thing suck.

First make or steal a string. For our case I will take this sad thing because fuck us.

Also no I did not ask permission to use this.

NEXT paste the string into the app, from either running "./main.bin" if you got the bin file or "python3 ./main.py" if you have python (on windows run it in IDLE I guess) (Idk how to run this on mac, nor do I care)

and then lookie here:

I made it so you too can shit on people for being sad or whatever that tweet was about. I didn't want to make this bullshit either.
