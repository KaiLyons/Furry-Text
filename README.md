# Furry Text
A monstrocity made by a human furry

## How to run it
Either run it as a python script or get the runnable .bin file from releases. [Python](https://github.com/SafyreLyons/F--ing-Furries/releases/download/1/main.bin) / [Vala](https://github.com/SafyreLyons/F--ing-Furries/releases/download/1.0/furries-python.bin) and write/paste a string in the test box and click the button. It ain't hard.
